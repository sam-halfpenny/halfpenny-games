            A Quinquagesimal code is a<br>
            base 50 number meaning instead<br>
            of using 10 symbols like the<br>
            decimal system it uses 50 so<br>
            <br>
            instead of:<br>
            0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9<br>
            <br>
            it uses:<br>
            0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J<br>
            K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j<br>
            k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t<br>
            <br>
            this enables each digit in the<br>
            code to represent both  a vertical<br>
            collumn and a blocktype<br>
            <br>blue: you
            <br>black: indestructable blocks
            <br>magenta: breakable block
            <br>red: hunters
            <br>yellow: snipers
            <br>cyan: cowboy<br>
            <br>
            each blocktype has a different set of<br>
            characters that tells the computer what<br>
            position to place the block. the<br>
            use of character set then enables<br>
            the computer to work out the respective<br>
            blocktype<br>
            <br>
            these are the characters sets and their corresponding blocktype:<br>
            0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 correspond to black blocks,<br>
            A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J correspond to magenta blocks,<br>
            K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T correspond to red blocks<br>
            a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j correspond to yellow blocks,<br>
            and k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t correspond to cyan blocks<br>
            <br>
            although the original position of red blocks doesnt<br>
            matter because they move anyway<br>
            <br>
            so therefore code 0AKak would build the level<br>
